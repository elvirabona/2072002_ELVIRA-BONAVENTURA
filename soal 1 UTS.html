                Android
            </div>
            <p>Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open
                source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
                Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially
                sponsored by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device launched
                in September 2008. It is free and open source software; its source code is known as Android Open Source
                Project (AOSP), which is primarily licensed under the Apache License. Android logo since 2019
                However most Android devices ship with additional proprietary software pre-installed, most notably
                Google Mobile Services (GMS) which includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution
                platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform. About 70 percent of
                Android smartphones run Google's ecosystem; competing Android ecosystems and forks include Fire OS
                (developed by Amazon) or LineageOS. However the "Android" name and logo are trademarks of Google which
                impose standards to restrict "uncertified" devices outside their ecosystem to use Android branding. The
                source code has been used to develop variants of Android on a range of other electronics, such as game
                consoles, digital cameras, portable media players, PCs and others, each with a specialized user
                interface. Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables,
                both developed by Google. Software packages on Android, which use the APK format, are generally
                distributed through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store, Samsung Galaxy Store, and
                Huawei AppGallery, or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid. Android has been the best-selling
                OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since 2013. As of May 2017, it has over two
                billion monthly active users, the largest installed base of any operating system, and as of August 2020,
                the Google Play Store features over 3 million apps. The current stable version is Android 11, released
                on September 8, 2020.</p>

            <p>Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California, in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears,
                and Chris White. Rubin described the Android project as "tremendous potential in developing smarter
                mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences".[17] The early intentions of
                the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras, and this was the basis of
                its pitch to investors in April 2004. The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large
                enough for its goals, and by five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a
                handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile. Rubin had difficulty
                attracting investors early on, and Android was facing eviction from its office space. Steve Perlman, a
                close friend of Rubin, brought him $10,000 in cash in an envelope, and shortly thereafter wired an
                undisclosed amount as seed funding. Perlman refused a stake in the company, and has stated "I did it
                because I believed in the thing, and I wanted to help Andy." Since 2008, Android has seen numerous
                updates which have incrementally improved the operating system, adding new features and fixing bugs in
                previous releases. Each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat,
                with the first few Android versions being called "Cupcake", "Donut", "Eclair", and "Froyo", in that
                order. During its announcement of Android KitKat in 2013, Google explained that "Since these devices
                make our lives so sweet, each Android version is named after a dessert", although a Google spokesperson
                told CNN in an interview that "It's kind of like an internal team thing, and we prefer to be a little
                bit — how should I say — a bit inscrutable in the matter, I'll say".
                In 2010, Google launched its Nexus series of devices, a lineup in which Google partnered with different
                device manufacturers to produce new devices and introduce new Android versions. The series was described
                as having "played a pivotal role in Android's history by introducing new software iterations and
                hardware standards across the board", and became known for its "bloat-free" software with "timely ...
                updates". At its developer conference in May 2013, Google announced a special version of the Samsung
                Galaxy S4, where, instead of using Samsung's own Android customization, the phone ran "stock Android"
                and was promised to receive new system updates fast. The device would become the start of the Google
                Play edition program, and was followed by other devices, including the HTC One Google Play edition, and
                Moto G Google Play edition. In 2015, Ars Technica wrote that "Earlier this week, the last of the Google
                Play edition Android phones in Google's online storefront were listed as "no longer available for sale"
                and that "Now they're all gone, and it looks a whole lot like the program has wrapped up". Eric Schmidt,
                Andy Rubin and Hugo Barra at a 2012 press conference announcing Google's Nexus 7 tablet From 2008 to
                2013, Hugo Barra served as product spokesperson, representing Android at press conferences and Google
                I/O, Google's annual developer-focused conference. He left Google in August 2013 to join Chinese phone
                maker Xiaomi. Less than six months earlier, Google's then-CEO Larry Page announced in a blog post that
                Andy Rubin had moved from the Android division to take on new projects at Google, and that Sundar Pichai
                would become the new Android lead. Pichai himself would eventually switch positions, becoming the new
                CEO of Google in August 2015 following the company's restructure into the Alphabet conglomerate, making
                Hiroshi Lockheimer the new head of Android. In June 2014, Google announced Android One, a set of
                "hardware reference models" that would "allow [device makers] to easily create high-quality phones at
                low costs", designed for consumers in developing countries. In September, Google announced the first set
                of Android One phones for release in India. However, Recode reported in June 2015 that the project was
                "a disappointment", citing "reluctant consumers and manufacturing partners" and "misfires from the
                search company that has never quite cracked hardware". Plans to relaunch Android One surfaced in August
                2015, with Africa announced as the next location for the program a week later. A report from The
                Information in January 2017 stated that Google is expanding its low-cost Android One program into the
                United States, although The Verge notes that the company will presumably not produce the actual devices
                itself. Google introduced the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones in October 2016, marketed as being the
                first phones made by Google, and exclusively featured certain software features, such as the Google
                Assistant, before wider rollout. The Pixel phones replaced the Nexus series, with a new generation of
                Pixel phones launched in October 2017.</p>
            <h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1>
            <p>The main hardware platform for Android is ARM (the ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures), with x86 and x86-64
                architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android. The unofficial Android-x86 project
                provided support for x86 architectures ahead of the official support. The ARMv5TE and MIPS32/64
                architectures were also historically supported but removed in later Android releases. Since 2012,
                Android devices with Intel processors began to appear, including phones and tablets. While gaining
                support for 64-bit platforms, Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64. Since
                Android 5.0 "Lollipop", 64-bit variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the 32-bit
                variants.</p>
            <h1 id="reception">Reception</h1>
            <h2>Market Share</h2>
            <p>According to a Statistica's estimate, Android smartphones had an installed base of 1.8 billion units in
                2015, which was 76% of the estimated total number of smartphones worldwide. Android has the largest
                installed base of any mobile operating system and, since 2013, the highest-selling operating system
                overall with sales in 2012, 2013 and 2014 close to the installed base of all PCs. In the second quarter
                of 2014, Android's share of the global smartphone shipment market was 84.7%, a new record. This had
                grown to 87.5% worldwide market share by the third quarter of 2016, leaving main competitor iOS with
                12.1% market share. According to an April 2017 StatCounter report, Android overtook Microsoft Windows to
                become the most popular operating system for total Internet usage. It has maintained the plurality since
                then. In September 2015, Google announced that Android had 1.4 billion monthly active users. This
                changed to 2 billion monthly active users in May 2017.</p>
            <h2>Platform information</h2>
            <p>As of November 2020, Android 10 is the most popular version at 37% and Android 9.0 Pie the next most
                popular with 24%, giving those two latest releases well over half the share. In virtually all countries
                is Android 8.1 Oreo or later version most popular. In several countries is Android 10 alone at or over
                50% share (or close to). Android 9.0 alone is also commonly near half of the market share, or over, on
                smartphones. One in four devices run on version older than Android 8.0, meaning not supported with
                security updates. On tablets, Android 5.1 Lollipop is the single most widespread version at 16.68% (most
                Android tablets use unsupported Android versions), and Android KitKat 10.0 thereafter at 13.97%. Android
                10 has grown its share over 10-fold in 8 weeks. The usage share of Android on tablets varies a lot by
                country; still, Lollipop 5.1 is the single version with the greatest usage share in the United States at
                32.27%, while a recent Pie 9.0 version is most widespread in e.g. Australia and India, some European
                countries, and Oreo 8.1 in China, and Egypt. In Australia, Android Pie 9.0 is the most popular at
                30.22%, and in India at 25.94%. In some countries, such as Thailand and Kuwait, latest Android 10 is
                most popular at 20%.</p>
