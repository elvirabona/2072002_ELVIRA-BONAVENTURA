        In visions of the dark night<br>
        I have dreamed of joy departed—<br>
        But a waking dream of life and light<br>
        Hath left me broken-hearted.<br>
        <br>
        Ah! what is not a dream by day<br>
        To him whose eyes are cast<br>
        On things around him with a ray<br>
        Turned back upon the past?<br>
        <br>
        That holy dream—that holy dream,<br>
        While all the world were chiding,<br>
        Hath cheered me as a lovely beam<br>
        A lonely spirit guiding.<br>
        <br>
        What though that light, thro' storm and night,<br>
        So trembled from afar—<br>
        What could there be more purely bright<br>
        In Truth's day-star?<br>
